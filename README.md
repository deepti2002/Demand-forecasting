Demand Forecasting

Business Objective:

Demand Forecasting:

          This Demand Forecasting will help businesses to predict the quantity of goods and services, which will be demanded by consumers. If we forecast the customer demand for the future, it will be useful to make good business and that is where Data Scientist’s or any person who will handle the data will come into picture.


             We had a requirement related to forecasting the demand from a business point, and found sample data from the web. We will be having a sample of 2 years of Historical data and asking to forecast the next year.


Final Deployment should be done in Either Flask, Streamlit, AWS up to the interest of the team.

Data Set Details:
train.csv
•	The training data, comprising time series of features store_nbr, family, and onpromotion as well as the target sales.
•	store_nbr identifies the store at which the products are sold.
•	family identifies the type of product sold.
•	sales gives the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date. Fractional values are possible since products can be sold in fractional units (1.5 kg of cheese, for instance, as opposed to 1 bag of chips).
•	onpromotion gives the total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store at a given date.

MY WORK:

1.	Data Analysis and Preprocessing:
•	I analyzed the historical sales data to identify patterns, trends, and seasonality using techniques such as time series decomposition, autocorrelation analysis, and exploratory data analysis.
•	I preprocessed the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables to ensure data quality and compatibility with the modeling techniques.

2.	Model Development and Evaluation:
•	I developed forecasting models using various techniques such as ARIMA, SARIMA, machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting), and deep learning architectures (e.g., LSTM, CNN) to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
•	I implemented hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and model diagnostics to optimize model performance and prevent overfitting.
•	I evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics such as RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and conducted comparative analysis to identify the most accurate and reliable forecasting model.

3.	Business Insights and Recommendations:
•	I derived actionable insights from the analysis, such as identifying sales trends, seasonality effects, and potential factors influencing sales performance.
•	I provided recommendations for inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic planning based on the forecasting models' predictions and insights derived from the data analysis.

4.	Coding and Implementation:
•	I implemented the modeling techniques using Python and relevant libraries such as pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, and tensorflow/keras.
•	I developed modular, reusable code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to streamline the analysis workflow and ensure reproducibility.
•	I handled libraries and dependencies in the Python environment using virtual environments and package managers to manage project dependencies and ensure a clean and organized development environment.

5.	Communication and Presentation:
•	I effectively communicated the project findings, methodologies, and recommendations to both technical and non-technical stakeholders through project reports, presentations, and interactive discussions.
•	I employed clear and concise language, visual aids, and storytelling techniques to convey complex technical concepts and results in an understandable and engaging manner.
•	I structured the project report or presentation in a logical and coherent manner, following a storytelling approach to guide the audience through the project narrative from data exploration to model deployment.


FINAL DEPLOYMENT
We have to run the py file in terminal to the streamlit user interface web page:
In terminal:
cd /path/to/file
streamlit run project1.py
